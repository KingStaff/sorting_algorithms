0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O
Learning Objectives:
By completing this project, you will learn:

Four different sorting algorithms commonly used to arrange data efficiently.
The concept of Big O notation and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm.
How to select the most appropriate sorting algorithm based on the input data and its characteristics.
What makes a sorting algorithm "stable" and how it impacts the order of equal elements after sorting.
